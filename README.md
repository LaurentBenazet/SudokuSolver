# SudokuSolver

Welcome to this repository !
Here I will explore different sudoku solver, in python.

Currently, two backtracking solvers are implemented, tested and working.

The V2 takes about 0.065s for the "hard" sudoku grid I put in the tests, the V1 takes about 0.11s for the same grid.

There is also a little benchmark part (not automated though) in the package ExecutionTime
